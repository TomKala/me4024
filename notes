• When powering up, ensure to power up the enclosures and associated data host in the following order:
○ Drive enclosures first – Ensures that the disks in the drive enclosure have enough time to completely spin up before being scanned
by the controller modules within the controller enclosure. The LEDs blink while the enclosures power up. After the LEDs stop
blinking – if the LEDs on the front and back of the enclosure are not amber – the power-on sequence is complete, and no faults
have been detected.
○ Controller enclosure next – Depending upon the number and type of disks in the system, it may take several minutes for the
system to become ready.
○ Data host last (if powered off for maintenance purposes).

Modify SATP claim rule
Modifying the SATP claim rule is advantageous because it will apply to all current and future datastores that
are added to the ESXi host, but it requires a reboot to be applied. Once the rule is created and a reboot
occurs, all current, and future datastores will have the recommended setting applied to them.
To automatically set multipathing to round robin, and set the IOPS path change condition for all current and
future volumes mapped to an ESXi host, create a claim rule with the following command:
esxcli storage nmp satp rule add --vendor "DellEMC" --model "ME4" --satp
"VMW_SATP_ALUA" --psp "VMW_PSP_RR" --psp-option "iops=3" --claimoption="tpgs_on"
SATP claim rules cannot be edited; they can only be added or removed. To make changes to an SATP claim
rule, it must be removed and then re-added. To remove the claim rule, issue the following command:
esxcli storage nmp satp rule remove --vendor "DellEMC" --model "ME4" --satp
"VMW_SATP_ALUA" --psp "VMW_PSP_RR" --psp-option "iops=3" --claimoption="tpgs_on"
A reboot is required for claim rule changes to take effect
